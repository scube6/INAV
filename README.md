# INAV
I am trying INAV ALTHOLD mode in my quad. so the github inav website mentions that to enable althold mode i should have airmode enabled when switching to althold .i tried doing the same but my quad is not maintaining any althold and it just goes up with high thr value. can you help with it??? what should i do?
